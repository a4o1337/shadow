:: Shadow ::

Shadow is a snapshot management utility for the btrfs filesystem.  You can use it in 
tandem with package managers (such as pacman for Arch linux) to provide restore 
snapshots (similar to what Yum does for Fedora).

** btrfs on / is required

Shadow will snapshot all kernels/initrds as well as the root (/) filesystem for later
recovery.
